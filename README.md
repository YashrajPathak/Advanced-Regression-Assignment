# **House-Price-Prediction-Ridge-Lasso**
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

# General Information
- A ML Model is required to predict sales price of house.
- The Model was build using simple linear regression, and was further tuned using ridge and lasso regression
It is expected to build a ML Model which predicts the Sales price of House
The Dataset for Housing metrics was used in this project
# Conclusions
R2 Value of Train and Test dataset for Ridge and Lasso is approximately 0.89 and 0.86
There is a decrese in RSME Score in Lasso regression
# Technologies Used
numpy - version 1.19.5
pandas - version 1.1.5
matplotlib - version 3.2.2
seaborn - version 0.11.2
sklearn - version 0.0
